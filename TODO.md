# TODO

* everything with a .git directory is a git project
* find out certain topics
* custom tags based on a regular expression + number of occurences in pdf files
* find empty folders
* find "problematic"  files
* look into zip files and find out their contents

* use "fingerprints" of documents (the use of a selection of words) to categorize them

* use sqlite db for storing data about files

* give a "score" for certain tags
